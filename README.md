# PyPSA-Earth-Climate TRACE

## Overview:

## Installation:

1. Open your terminal at a location where you want to install pypsa-earth. Type the following in your terminal to download the package from GitHub:

   ```bash
      .../some/path/without/spaces % git clone https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth.git
   ```
2. The python package requirements are curated in the `envs/environment.yaml` file.
   The environment can be installed using:

```bash
    .../pypsa-earth % conda env create -f envs/environment.yaml
```

   If the above takes longer than 30min, you might want to try mamba for faster installation:

```bash
    (base) conda install -c conda-forge mamba

    .../pypsa-earth % mamba env create -f envs/environment.yaml
```

3. For running the optimization one has to install the solver. We can recommend the open source HiGHs solver which installation manual is given [here](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA/blob/633669d3f940ea256fb0a2313c7a499cbe0122a5/pypsa/linopt.py#L608-L632).
4. To use jupyter lab (new jupyter notebooks) **continue** with the [ipython kernel installation](http://echrislynch.com/2019/02/01/adding-an-environment-to-jupyter-notebooks/) and test if your jupyter lab works:

   ```bash
      .../pypsa-earth % ipython kernel install --user --name=pypsa-earth
      .../pypsa-earth % jupyter lab
   ```
5. Verify or install a java redistribution from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or equivalent.
   To verify the successful installation the following code can be tested from bash:

   ```bash
      .../pypsa-earth % java -version
   ```

   The expected output should resemble the following:

   ```bash
      java version "1.8.0_341"
      Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_341-b10)
      Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.341-b10, mixed mode)
   ```

## Test run on tutorial

- In the folder open a terminal/command window to be located at this path `~/pypsa-earth/`
- Activate the environment `conda activate pypsa-earth`
- Rename config.tutorial.yaml to config.yaml. For instance in Linux:
  ```bash
  mv config.tutorial.yaml config.yaml
  ```
- Run a dryrun of the Snakemake workflow by typing simply in the terminal:
  ```bash
  snakemake -j 1 solve_all_networks -n
  ```

  Remove the -n to do a real run. Follow the tutorial of PyPSA-Eur 1 and 2 on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty47YU1_eeQ) to continue with an analysis.
